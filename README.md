## Styled Fabric ui components

This repository illustrates some examples on how to style the OOTB Fabric ui react components for your SPFx projects. Each web part takes another approach. 
 - Globally styled: uses the ':global' selector to target the OOTB 'ms-' classes
 - Classname styled: creates custom class names and targets the elements. These class names are added to the Fabric ui react components
 - Function based styled: uses style functions to style componenst.
 - Component catalog: creates a component catalog with re-usable Fabric ui components with your custom styles

## Minimal path to awesom
 - clone the repo
 - run `npm install`
 - run `gulp serve`
 - add any of the components to the workbench
